0 - Sunday

1 - Monday

2 - Tuesday

3 - Wednesday

4 - Thursday

5 - Friday

6 - Saturday

Complete the function utility() with d and n as parameters. Print index for the day which is n days before the given day d.

 19 - 7

Example 1:

Input:
d = 4
n = 3
Output:
1
Explanation: 3 days before the 4th is 1
Example 2:

Input:
d = 2
n = 19
Output: 
4
Explanation: 19 days before the 2nd is 4
Your Task: 

Complete the function utility() with d and n as parameters. You have to print the index for the day which is n days before the given day d. Just print the answer after performing suitable operations without the New Line.
New line will be added by the driver code itself.



// observation

d can vary from 0 to 6 -  d means days
n is gap between days
Print index for the day which is n days before the given day d.


d = 4
n = 3

output ----- 1


d - n = 1

n will be days before d

gap =  d - n 
2 - 19 => 4
2 - 19 ====== > 4

day and gap identify day

ans will be in between 0 to 6

1 -17

Isa Upanishad verse 9

अन्धं तमः प्रविशन्ति येऽविद्यामुपासते।

ततो भूय इव ते तमो य उ विद्यायां रताः ॥

Into a blind darkness they enter who follow after Ignorance, they enter into even a greater darkness who devote themselves to Knowledge alone.

Knowledge can be a very dangerous self-harming tool if not balanced either with the awareness of its dangers or discarding any notions of self-grandeur. 

Knowledge easily tumhe ye convince kara sakti hai ki tum kuch ho, tum bohut kuch ho, tum param ho, all three of which will lead you to self worship (narcissism). 

ye self worship se bachne ke liye, tumhe ya to aware hona padega at all times ki knowledge ye mujhe ahankari pagal bana sakti hai ya tumhe ye accept karna padega ki as a manushya chahe kitna seekh lu ya paa lu, main rahunga dharti pe hi jahan sab insaan rehte hain. kisi se bada ya chota nahi hoon main. Sab samaan hain. 

ye do choti realizations bohut important hain apko ek self obsessed narcissist banne se rokne ke liye
