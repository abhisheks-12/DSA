New line will be added by the driver code itself.



// observation

d can vary from 0 to 6 -  d means days
n is gap between days
Print index for the day which is n days before the given day d.


d = 4
n = 3

output ----- 1


d - n = 1

n will be days before d

gap =  d - n 
2 - 19 => 4
2 - 19 ====== > 4

day and gap identify day

ans will be in between 0 to 6

1 -17
